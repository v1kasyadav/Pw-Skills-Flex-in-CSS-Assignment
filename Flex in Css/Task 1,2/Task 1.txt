Flexbox is a one dimentional layout system to align items horizontally or vertically in a container. Flex works only in one direction or we can say in single row or column.
flexbox is used to create navigation bars and sections on the web.

CSS Grid is two dimentional layout system in which we can work on the both direction horizontally and vertically. 
Css Grid is used to create image galleries,complex design websites.

Choosing gird or flexbox is completely depended on what we want to built if want to build something where i just have to work on the same direction like building nav bars and particular sections in websites
and if i have to build something  complex like image gallery, something where i have to create multiple cards like gallery.
